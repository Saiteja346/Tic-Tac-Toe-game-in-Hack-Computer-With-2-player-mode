About:
------
Tic-Jack-Toe is a two player and one palyer implementation of tic-tac-toe in the Jack programing language.  During a player's turn, the player must decide where to place a piece by entering a row and column.  Play will then pass to the opposing player.  The game will continue in this fashion until one player has won the game, by getting three of there peices in a row, or the board is full, resulting in a tie (a cat).
